<p class="p2"> Before any colonisation, people called the KhoiKhoi and San lived in South Africa, the earliest habitants being the San or also known as the bushmen who were descendants of Late Stone Age people. From 1100CE onwards, during the Middle Iron Age, came the Bantu expansion, where series of migrations took place of the original Proto-Bantu speaking group, spreading from Central Africa across much of Sub-Saharan Africa.  
<p class="p3"> After nearly a millennium later, the first Europeans to see South Africa come in as the Portuguese, who had colonies in India and the Indies. They explored the coasts and then in 1652 the Dutch find South Africa. </p>  
<p class="p4"> They founded Cape Town Hall, the Dutch used South Africa as a waste station for various ships, they imported their own farmers to use the land in SA, this situation ended in the 18th Century. This was because of the French invading the Dutch, which makes us move on to the next part. </p>
