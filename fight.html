<p class="p5"> In 1618, English King James 1 granted a monopoly on all business conducted in West Africa, to the Guinea company. This company did business for the rest of the 17th Century trading gold, timber and slaves, however because of all the disease in Africa brought in by the already settling Europeans, made it hard for the British to assert their dominance. But they knew how much it would mean and all the profit they would gain if they did take control of Africa.</p>
<p class="p6"> Because of the Dutch settlement in Cape, Britain’s work was almost done, as the Dutch had already monopolised the area. So when the Dutch were busy fighting the French in 1795, Britain took the opportunity to take over and dispatched two warships to colonise. </p>
<p class="p7">  By 1806, Britain had finally completely colonised Cape Town. </p>

 <h2 class="H2"> How did South Africa become independent? Were there any strugles? <h2>
 <p> In 1770, the Bantu speakers began to have conflicts with the people that came into their communities. These conflicts became what the British called the Boers war, the first Boer war was fought in 1880-1881, called the Transvaal Rebellion . Boer is a Dutch and Afrikaans word for farmers. There were 3 Boer wars altogether.</p>
 <p> In May 1910 The Union of South Africa was created, it was planned to be a union of white people, however the inhabitants of South Africa fought against this. This created the African National Congress (ANC) established in 1912. Moving on in December 1931, the Union became fully independent from the UK, ending British powers on the colony, this would actually be South Africa’s independence. However, there was a twist to this, the minority of white people ruled over the majority of black people,this lead to conflict between the two, causing aprtheid to occur.</p>
 <p>  Many anti-apartheid fighters were people like Nelson Mandela or Stephen Biko. South Africa finally gained independence in 31 May 1961. </p>

<h3> How is South Africa like right now? Is it successful or not? </h3>
<p> South Africa is now a very successful country with a high GDP of 419 billion US dollars, they are quite famous in sports especially, cricket and football. They still are affected by the apartheid, many white and black people still stay segregated from each other, so yes it is still facing consequences from British rule. </p>
